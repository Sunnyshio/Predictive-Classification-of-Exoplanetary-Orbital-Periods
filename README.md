# Predictive-Classification-of-Exoplanetary-Orbital-Periods

This project focuses on the predictive classification of exoplanetary orbital periods. By analyzing data collected from the Kepler Telescope, the model aims to accurately classify exoplanets based on their orbital periods into distinct categoriesâ€”short, medium, or long periods. Orbital period classification is essential for understanding the unique dynamics of exoplanetary systems and can offer insights into their formation, stability, and potential habitability.
