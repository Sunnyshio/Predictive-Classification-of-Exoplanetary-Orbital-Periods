# Predictive-Classification-of-Exoplanetary-Orbital-Periods

This project focuses on the predictive classification of exoplanetary orbital periods. By analyzing data collected from the Kepler Telescope, the model aims to accurately classify exoplanets based on their orbital periods into distinct categoriesâ€”short, medium, or long periods. Orbital period classification is essential for understanding the unique dynamics of exoplanetary systems and can offer insights into their formation, stability, and potential habitability.

### Libraries used
1. **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis, especially handling large datasets and creating dataframes.
2. **matplotlib.pyplot** and **seaborn**: For visualizing data distributions, relationships, and trends within the dataset.
3. **numpy**: For numerical operations and array manipulations essential for scientific computations.
4. **statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence**: To calculate the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), assessing multicollinearity among features.
5. **sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler**: For standardizing features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which is crucial for many machine learning algorithms.
6. **sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split**: For splitting data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
7. **scipy.stats.mstats.winsorize**: For handling outliers by limiting extreme values.
8. **sklearn.preprocessing.PowerTransformer**: For transforming features to improve normality, particularly useful for skewed data.
9. **statsmodels.api**: Provides a variety of statistical models, including logistic regression, used for inferential statistics.
10. **sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression**: The main classification algorithm for predicting the categories of exoplanetary orbital periods.
11. **sklearn.metrics (confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, classification_report)**: For evaluating model performance, providing insights into accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.
